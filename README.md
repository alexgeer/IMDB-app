The final project for Data Modeling in my Junior year of undergrad.

A rather basic (and slow) implementation that nonetheless works. 
I'm wincing looking at this code now. 

Our professor really threw us out into the wilderness with this one. Just dumped the data on us and told us, "clean it".

Thus began my usage of python. It really speaks to the power of the language that as an undergrad I was able to be productive with Python literally the first I opened the interpreter. I later implemented the data cleaning as script. Fun stuff!
