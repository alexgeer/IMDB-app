The final project for Data Modeling in my Junior year of undergrad.

Using a kaggle data dump of IMDB movie data, create a search and recommendation engine.
The recommendation engine is implemented as a pivot table. We were required to use Java for the application and for importing the data into a MySQL db, though we were allowed to use any method or language to clean and prepare the data. It would be much more sane to implement mostly in python, and just use Java for the interface. After using Javascript and Python for the last year I'm finding the verbosity of Java here a little... disconcerting. Like a sci-fi author's imagination of what an advanced programming language would look like. I'm not knocking Java though (ok, I am a little bit)!

A rather basic (and slow) implementation that nonetheless works. 
I'm wincing looking at this code now. 

Our professor really threw us out into the wilderness with this one. Just dumped the data on us and told us, "clean it".

Thus began my usage of python. It really speaks to the power of the language that as an undergrad I was able to be productive with Python literally the first I opened the interpreter. I later implemented the data cleaning as script. Fun stuff!
